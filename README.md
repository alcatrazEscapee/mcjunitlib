# Suck Eggs

![Curseforge](https://github.com/alcatrazEscapee/suck-eggs/workflows/Curseforge%20Build%20+%20Upload/badge.svg)

A Minecraft mod that allows you to suck eggs. Basically, you can eat them, but they don't get consumed. They restore a teeny amount of saturation, but no hunger.

You can still throw eggs by sneaking.

Yeah.

That's all folks.
